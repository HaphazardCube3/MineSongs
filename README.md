MineSongs – Music Player In Minecraft

Enjoy your favorite music inside Minecraft with a simple, lightweight in-game player built for creators, builders, grinders, and anyone who wants some background vibes while playing.

Features

🎵 Play any YouTube song directly in Minecraft

⏯️ Play/Pause/Stop controls

🔊 Smooth volume slider

🎮 Clean in-game GUI

🔑 Quick key bindings (M, P, N)

Current Limitation: Since MineSongs downloads tracks directly from YouTube on demand, users may experience a short 4–10 second delay before a song starts. This happens because the audio has to be fetched and processed in real time.

Future Plans

We’re already working on future iterations that expand beyond YouTube, including:

🟢 Spotify compatibility

🍎 Apple Music integration

These upgrades will allow players to enjoy music from multiple platforms, not just YouTube.
